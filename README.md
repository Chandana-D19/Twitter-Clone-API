# Twitter-Clone-API
Hello!!
 Developed a Twitter-like backend system using Node.js, Express.js, and SQLite.
 Designed and implemented RESTful APIs to handle user registration, authentication (JWT), tweets, likes,
 and replies.
 Managed user relationships (followers/following) and ensured secure access to data using middleware
 authentication.
 Implemented database schema and optimized SQL queries for efficient data retrieval.
 Used Express.js for routing and JWT for user authentication.
 Enabled CRUD operations for tweets, likes, and replies while enforcing access control.
